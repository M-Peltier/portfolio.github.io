“SHOULD THIS LOAN BE APPROVED OR DENIED?” A LARGE DATASET WITH CLASS ASSIGNMENT GUIDELINES

ABSTRACT In this article, a large and rich dataset from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and an accompanying 
assignment designed to teach statistics as an investigative process of decision making are presented. 
Guidelines for the assignment titled “Should This Loan Be Approved or Denied?,” along with a subset of the larger dataset, are provided. 
For this case-study assignment, students assumed the role of loan officer at a bank and are 
asked to approve or deny a loan by assessing its risk of default using logistic regression.
